[tox]
; This tox configuration is based on examples at:

; https://github.com/JulienPalard/oeis/blob/14bea829d556bd617426c8a85235ba5da1b9f157/tox.ini
; Specify the environments to run - we run the required
; Python/Django version combinations and we'll store code
; coverage information for each (see testenv). Then we
; run the coverage env target to combine coverage info.
; Note that this has been updated to remove the use of pytest-cov
; since this complicated parallel runs via GHA. Since we're no longer
; using append (via pytest-cov), this means we also don't need an inital
; coverage clean step since previous coverage files are overwritten.
