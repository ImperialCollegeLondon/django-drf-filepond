#        A better approach would be to use python-magic but this
#        introduces another dependency and will likely result in
#        issues on some platforms.
#        Another option is to store the MIME type in the DB when the
#        file is uploaded and look this up and return it.
#
# At present this helper function takes only the filename (the data
# parameter). If this is refactored to use something like python-magic,
# 'data' will be the header data from the file to enable file type detection.
